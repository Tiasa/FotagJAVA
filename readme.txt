//////////////////// Requirements ////////////////////

Accomplished the following:

Used and implemented MVC pattern using Java's observer interface
Grid layout and List layout
Clear button for rating and filter
Proper rating and filter widgets
Clicking on an image enlarges on a separate window. That window closes on close operation
When application closes it saves the meta data. When it is opened, it tries to load from
a file. If the file doesn't exit, the canvas is empty.
Have at least one distinct model, and at least two views.
No horizontal scroll bar visible.
All widgets are Java 8/Swing-based. No 3rd party/platform native.

Couldn't Implement:
    Better implementation of the list layout
    Proper window resizing dynamic layout
